# CS-106 (computer science course)

## In this course, I learned the algorithms and data structures.

### The course include 13 assignments:
    - Assignment 1: work with Karel lib. In this assignment need to solve 4 tasks:
        - Pick up the beeper
        - To complete the columns, lay out the beepers
        - Find the middle of the board
        - Put beeper in the chessboard order
    - Assignment 2: work with a window programm and a graphic lib. In this assignment need to solve 6 tasks:
        - Draw the illusion with the rectangle and ovals
        - Code the quadratic expression
        - Draw the toes
        - Draw the flag of any country
        - Draw the matrix in the middle of the screen
        - Draw the caterpiller
    - Assignment 3: work with a standart java lib and a graphic lib. In this assignment need to solve 6 tasks:
        - Create exercises cheker
        - Create the program the asks a user for a number and output the numbers in the Collatz conjecture format
        - Create the program the asks a user for a number and output the to power result
        - Draw the pyramid
        - St. Petersburg paradox
        - Create 5 second animation
    - Assignment 4: work with the graphic lib. In this assignment need to create the Brackout! game
    - Assignment 5: work with the strings:
        - Create the program that counts the number of syllabels
        - Create the program that asks a user for the numbers and calculate it as a string
        - Create CSV parsing
    - Assignment 6: work with arrays
        - Create the program that decode image and find the hidden image
        - Create the program that equal the histogram
        - Create the tonematrix
    - Assignment 7: work with dashboard. In this assignment need to create the program that draw graphs of name popularity in different years
    - Assignment 10-11: create the calculator.
        In this assignment I use the Hierarchical data structure â€” binary tree, to parse and save the expression.
    Assignment 12-13: create the program that find the silhouettes on the image.
        In the assignment 12 I use the DFS (mandatory requirements) to traverse the silhouettes
        In the assignment 13 I use the BFS (mandatory requirements)
